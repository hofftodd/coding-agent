"""Aider (https://aider.chat) as a one-shot, non-interactive executor.

The run's model gateway is passed as an OpenAI-compatible API base. The files
the task may change are added to the chat (Aider creates the ones that don't
exist yet); the context files go in read-only. Foreman commits the result
itself, so Aider's own commits are off.

Aider is optional in the executor image: build it with
``--build-arg WITH_AIDER=1``. Without it, tasks fail with a configuration
error instead of being retried.
