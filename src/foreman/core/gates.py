"""Checkpoints ("gates") and the "Needs you" inbox (FR-7).

A project's ``gates`` setting turns the optional checkpoints on or off:

    plan_approval   review the task breakdown before it runs        (default on)
    replan_approval approve every plan revision from the replanner  (default off)
    task_merge      approve each validated task before it merges    (default off)
    milestone       approve before the milestone is pushed / PR'd   (default on)

Always on, whatever the settings: spec approval, spec changes proposed by the
replanner, plan growth beyond the cap, and blocked tasks.

Opening a gate records it, emits an event and (if FOREMAN_NTFY_URL is set)
sends a push notification. Resolving one only records the decision; the
orchestrator carries it out.
