"""Supervisor process: executes Stop / E-stop requests.

Deliberately small and independent of the orchestrator. For each request in
control.db it:

1. reads the affected runs from foreman.db (WAL reads never wait for a writer),
2. kills their containers / process groups by handle - this needs no database
   write, so it works even if a hung orchestrator holds foreman.db's write lock,
3. then records the outcome: tasks -> stopped_by_user, runs -> stopped,
   project paused (these writes may wait for the lock; the processes are
   already dead by then),
4. acknowledges the request in control.db.

The orchestrator independently consults control.db before advancing any task,
so it can never report a stopped task as failed or carry on with it.

It also sweeps orphans: foreman containers whose run is no longer open.
