"""Milestone completion: when every task is done, run the acceptance command.

- passes  -> the project is done; with the ``milestone`` checkpoint (default on)
             the user approves, then the milestone branch is pushed and a GitHub
             pull request is opened (if the repo is on GitHub and a token is set);
- fails   -> the replanner gets the failure output and may add tasks, up to
             ``max_acceptance_failures`` times; then an inbox item asks the user.

The check runs in the same sandbox as tasks, on a fresh clone of the milestone
branch, and only once per commit.
