```

- `api`, `orchestrator`, `supervisor` are separate OS processes (one repo,
  three entry points) so a hung orchestrator cannot block Stop.
- The DB is the only channel between them: commands table, stop flags,
  heartbeats. Supervisor is deliberately tiny and has no model calls.

## 4. Key data model (abridged)

- `Project(id, repo_url, workspace_path, phase, autonomy_gates, budgets, role_bindings)`
- `Node(id, base_url, capacity, models, healthy, last_seen)`
- `Task(id, project_id, title, req_refs, todos, allowed_globs, validation_cmd, deps, state, budgets, attempt)`
- `TaskRun(id, task_id, node_id, model, started, ended, outcome, tokens, cost, diff_hash, error_sig)`
- `Event(id, project_id, task_id, kind, payload, ts)` — transcript, tool calls, watchdog, gates
- `PlanRevision(id, project_id, version, ops, reason, approved_by)`
- `Gate(id, project_id, kind, payload, state)`
- `Control(id, scope, target_id, action[pause|stop|estop], created, acknowledged)`

Task states: `queued → running → validating → done`, plus `blocked`,
`waiting_gate`, `stopped_by_user`, `failed`, `discarded`.

## 5. Context pack

Built per task attempt, persisted for audit:
1. System prompt for the executor role (rules, scope fence, how to run tests).
2. Requirement slice (spec excerpts referenced by `req_refs`).
3. Todos.
4. Interface context: signatures/types of symbols the task depends on
   (extracted with tree-sitter/ast, not whole files).
5. Contents of allowed files (current).
6. Validation command and, on retry, a summary of the previous failure
   (never the full prior transcript).

Size is token-counted against the executor model's configured usable context;
over-budget ⇒ the task is returned to the planner to split.

## 6. Milestones

### M0 — Spike (no app code) — skipped by decision; model choice deferred to real use
Manually run Spec Kit-style spec → decomposition → OpenCode/Aider on the R9700
and Mac against a toy repo. Record: which models follow tool protocols, real
usable context, tokens/s, typical failure modes. Output: `specs/000-orchestrator/spike-notes.md`
and default role bindings.

### M1 — Walking skeleton + stop ✅
- Project add/clone, node registry, role bindings.
- Manual task creation; sequential execution on one node via OpenCode in Docker.
- Validation run, merge to milestone branch.
- Supervisor + Pause/Stop/E-stop end-to-end.
- Live task view (SSE transcript, diff, test output).

### M2 — Specify & decompose ✅
- Phase 1 chat with planner, doc editing, commits to `specs/`.
- Validation tests generation; Phase 1 approval gate.
- Decomposition with size enforcement and context packs.

### M3 — Autonomy
- Watchdog rules + escalation ladder.
- Replanner with plan revisions, growth cap, spec-change gate.
- Configurable gates + "Needs you" inbox + ntfy notifications.
- Milestone PRs on GitHub.

### M4 — Multi-node & polish
- Multi-node scheduling with capacities, node health view.
- Cloud spend tracking and caps.
- Portfolio dashboard, validation trend charts.
- Aider executor; crash-recovery hardening.

## 7. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Local executors unreliable at tool use | M0 spike picks models; escalation ladder; tiny tasks |
| Mac prefill latency | Small context packs; Mac reserved for planner/escalation |
| Replanner churn | Growth cap, reasons required, spec-change gate |
| Validation tests themselves wrong | Phase 1 human approval; tests changes always gated |
| Executor CLI interface drift | `Executor` protocol + pinned versions + contract tests |

## 8. M1 implementation notes

Design changes made while building M1 (spec updated where relevant):

- **Task clones instead of git worktrees.** A worktree's `.git` file points at
  an absolute host path, which would force mounting the main repository (and
  its config) into the container. Each task gets a standalone local clone with
  no remote; the orchestrator pushes the task branch back into the main clone
  to merge.
- **Two databases.** Stop requests and the E-stop flag live in `control.db`,
  which the orchestrator only reads. Found by the frozen-orchestrator test
  (V8.2): an orchestrator stopped mid-transaction holds `foreman.db`'s write
  lock, which previously blocked recording a Stop at all.
- **Kill first, record second.** The supervisor kills processes before writing
  any state, and the runner consults `control.db` before advancing or failing
  a task, so a stop is never reported as a failure.
- **Heartbeats are files** (mtime), so liveness never contends for a lock.
- **Containers are labelled with an instance id** so the orphan sweep never
  touches another foreman installation's containers on the same host.
- **One active task per project** in M1 (tasks merge into one milestone
  branch); parallelism comes from multiple projects and node capacity.
- **Scope fence implemented early** (it was planned for M3): changes outside a
  task's allowed globs fail the task.

### Validation coverage after M1

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| V1.1, V1.2 projects & config | ✅ `tests/test_api.py` |
| V3.3 deps respected | ✅ `test_dependencies_run_in_order` |
| V4.1 own clone/branch/container, no secrets | ✅ `tests/test_docker.py` |
| V4.2 regression blocks done | ✅ (exit-code based; per-test regression counting is M3) |
| V4.3 node capacity | ✅ `test_node_capacity_respected` |
| V4.4 image, non-root, mounts | ✅ — **egress allowlist not yet implemented** (containers use the default bridge network) |
| V5.2 scope fence | ✅ `test_scope_fence` |
| V5.3 time budget | ✅ `test_timeout` (iteration/token budgets: M3) |
| V8.1–V8.5 stop controls | ✅ `tests/test_stop.py` (real processes), `tests/test_docker.py`, Playwright `web/e2e` |
| V9.1 crash recovery | ✅ `test_orchestrator_crash_recovery` |
| E2E-2 (stop from UI) | ✅ `scripts/e2e.sh` |
| V2.x, V3.1–V3.2, V5.1, V5.4, V6–V7, V10, E2E-1 | M2–M4 |

### Known gaps carried into M2+

- Network egress restriction for executor containers (FR-4.6).
- The node's API key (if any) is written into the OpenCode config inside the
  run's read-only control mount; cloud keys must go through a host-side proxy
  before cloud executors are allowed (NFR-5).
- Per-project toolchain images (`.foreman/Dockerfile`) are not built yet; the
  base image only has git + OpenCode, so validation commands that need a
  language runtime require a custom `FOREMAN_EXECUTOR_IMAGE` for now.
- No GitHub PR creation yet (milestone branch is merged locally and optionally
  pushed).

## 9. M2 implementation notes

- **Planner protocol.** The planner writes documents with full-file blocks
  (`<<<FILE path ... >>>`) and sets the acceptance command with
  `<<<ACCEPTANCE_CMD ... >>>`. Plain text blocks, rather than tool calls, so
  small local models can follow it. Writes are limited to
  `specs/<feature>/{spec,plan,validation}.md`, `tests/acceptance/**` and
  `.foreman/Dockerfile`; anything else is refused and reported in the chat.
  Current documents go in the system prompt on every turn, so the
  conversation history only carries the talk (and is trimmed oldest-first to
  fit the planner's window).
- **Planner jobs** run inside the orchestrator, stream into the dashboard,
  and are stoppable mid-stream: project Stop / E-stop closes the model
  connection and nothing is applied (CAS on the job state). A failure while
  applying results is reported, not swallowed.
- **Providers.** `openai` = any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (raw streaming
  HTTP). `anthropic` = Claude through the official SDK, adaptive thinking,
  server-side refusal fallback (`fallbacks: "default"`) on models that support
  it. Claude nodes can only be planners (NFR-5).
- **Context packs** (`core/contextpack.py`): requirement slice by id, Python
  interfaces via `ast` (signatures + first docstring line, no bodies), other
  languages via signature-line matching, editable files' current contents
  (clipped at 400 lines), validation and test commands. Tokens are estimated
  at ~4 chars/token against `context_budget_pct` (default 35%) of the executor
  node's `context_window`. The runner refuses to start a task whose pack is
  over budget.
- **Size rules** (FR-3.3): explicit files only (no wildcards), at most
  `max_task_files` (default 3), a validation command, pack within budget,
  requirement ids that exist in the spec, and no edits to the spec documents.
  Violations go back to the planner (up to 3 attempts); what remains is shown
  in plan review and blocks approval until fixed by hand.
- **Phases:** `specify -> decomposing -> plan_review -> execute`. Tasks only
  run in `execute`. `skip_spec` creates a project straight in `execute` for
  hand-written tasks (this is how the M1 tests and screenshots run).
- **Schema migration:** new columns are added to existing SQLite databases on
  startup (`db._add_missing_columns`), so v1 data directories keep working.

### Validation coverage after M2

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| V2.1 chat produces and commits the documents | ✅ `tests/test_spec_flow.py` |
| V2.2 no `execute` without spec approval | ✅ approval endpoint + phase gate; tasks don't run before `execute` (projects created with `skip_spec` opt out by design) |
| V3.1 generated tasks have all fields | ✅ `tests/test_planner.py` |
| V3.2 over-budget tasks are split, never queued | ✅ retry loop + approval block (`test_oversized_task_is_sent_back_to_be_split`, `test_persistent_violations_block_plan_approval`) |
| V3.3 acyclic graph | ✅ cycle detection before tasks are created |
| V8.5 in-flight planner stream aborted on Stop | ✅ `test_stop_aborts_planner_mid_stream_and_applies_nothing` |
| E2E-1 spec → done with a real executor | ✅ `test_spec_to_done_with_opencode` (Docker, OpenCode, fake model) and Playwright `web/e2e/spec.spec.ts` |

### Known gaps carried into M3+

- Network egress restriction for executor containers (FR-4.6) — still open.
- Per-project toolchain images: the planner can write `.foreman/Dockerfile`,
  but foreman doesn't build or use it yet.
- Planner jobs don't count against node capacity.
- Token counts are estimates (chars/4), not tokenizer-exact.
- Watchdog, replanning after each task, and the remaining checkpoints are M3.
